CST205-Project-2
================

This project uses Jython in the JES environment to convert a sound file (.wav) into a video visualization (.avi)

AllPossiblePixels
  This creates an image that has all of the possible pixels combinations that can be made with rgb values from 0-255

SoundVisualizer V1
  This doesn't take any sound, but creates a video of a circle and line moving across a screen

SoundVisualizer V2
  This works, but the video is a little longer than the song, making the visualization not quite sync up with the sound

SoundVisualizer V3
  This will be an improvement of V2, using a while loop instead of a for loop
